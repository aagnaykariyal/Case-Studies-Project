My brain knew this was wrong but the rules imposed by everyone else around told me that it was normal and that if i didn't accept that then I would never fit in anywhere.

With respect to what your gf said, she isn’t exactly wrong (if you’re from the US), but there is some nuance to be had there. On an individual basis, of course any individual can be racist toward any other individual.

However, white people engaging in racist acts against a minority group hits a lot harder because there are systemic systems built from the ground up to benefit them at the expense of every other race. White racism towards minorities is reinforced by institutions at the societal, state, and federal level.

That’s why there is no equivalent to the N word for white people. It sort of doesn’t matter if a black person is racist on a grand scale, because as a whole, black people are disenfranchised and oppressed by the vast majority of existing institutions.

When people say ‘black people cant be racist’, it means that black individuals being racist are such without systemic reinforcement, which ultimately is toothless in the face of a world that penalizes their existence while simultaneously rewarding white existence.

I used to live in a rural town where it was the worst. A few white men in a truck threw full beer cans at me while screaming slurs, my neighbor told me not to approach their house and displayed their shotgun, customer service reps in grocery stores and gas stations and restuarants did not speak to me and sometimes outright did not serve me. I once went to a restuarant where I had to stand up and find the server each time I wanted something and they still took 15 mins to bring every little thing like the menu, water, take my order and so on. I got followed in the grocery store as if I was stealing when I wasn't. 

My experience is usually just that of being treated like I'm less than other humans. Surprisingly though I don't let any of it get to me.

My experiences are very different from yours apparently because the vast majority of racism I got was from non black people. Most of the racism from black people was othering.  Letting me know that I'm not included because of how I talk and the music I listen to.  I don't code switch. I never have.

The most racist black person I knew was a girl who just bullied the s*** out of me.  Called me sell out and Uncle Tom all the time but the thing is eventually she asked me out. I was not even kind of attracted to her. Her friend eventually told me that she just had a giant crush on me and that is how she dealt with it.

The thing about black people is you might be thinking your experiencing racism when you're just getting the experience that black people sometimes give each other.  

One thing all black people in this country share is experience. Especially the experience of not having the privilege of walking around and never thinking about your race. It has to be on our mind for survival.  This country gives a lot of immigrants this last place avoidance mentality and black people are always the ones in last place.

The kind of racism that I got from non black people was very different. It went from just uninformed ignorance, othering and curiosity to ""your kind doesn't deserve to exist"".   In the middle was the absurd racism that I got from people who weren't even from America but felt they were more American and ""white"" despite being from Central America or East Asia.

Don't ever forget how weird it is to be black in America. This country fought a war specifically to enslave people who had any African ancestry. The other side lost and everyone stopped talking about it until about the 1910s when everything changed. Suddenly those people were being celebrated and they are still celebrated today. There are still nine military bases named after Confederate soldiers in America. 9 military bases named after men who fought to keep African people enslaved.

I noticed people would make jokes about 'slitty eyes' (not my words) around me only once they knew I was part Chinese and then feign innocence when I told them to stop. Usually, they would say, ""You don't have slitty eyes so why are you offended?"" 

Plus the stereotypical ""ching chong"" jokes would come up.

There's also a lot of stereotypes about Chinese people eating bats, being dirty, that we're all communists and evil. I wholeheartedly believe people are disappointed when they realise the Asian I'm mixed with is Chinese, rather than South Korean or Japanese. People always look so disappointed when I say, ""No, I'm Chinese"" and then they tend to list whatever stereotypes they can think of.

In recent years people have asked me if I wished I was something else and I find that pretty upsetting. There's nothing wrong with being Chinese.

From other Chinese people, well they have a tendency to not view 'mixed Chinese' people as Chinese at all. So the few Chinese friends I had growing up either hid their friendship with me from their parents or were actively told to stop talking to me once their parents found out. It made me feel very excluded from the small Chinese community around me.

65,0.051,0.828,0.121,0.9478,"No problem. :) And yeah, I definitely think that’s bound to happen in places like Texas, California, etc. because most of the Latin/Hispanic community there tends to have Mexican roots and many of them have Asian ancestry due the genetic legacy of the Manila gallons trade that lasted between 1565 and 1815. 

Btw, I didn’t mean to get all “Dora the Explorer” on you, lol. I don’t expect everyone to know these things (I’m still learning a lot about my own diverse ancestry), but I just find it really disheartening when many people genuinely seem to think that Asian diasporas don’t exist in certain parts of the world (like the Caribbean, South America, etc) … when they absolutely do exist and have for many centuries. A couple examples: Spain colonized The Philippines for over three centuries, Cuba has one of the oldest Chinatowns in history and the largest Nikkei community in the world is actually in Brazil. Peru even had a President in the 1990s who’s parents were Japanese immigrants. 

So yeah, I know when people think of “Latine” & “Hispanic” the first thing that they think about is often European colonialism, but that’s just one piece of a much larger and diverse puzzle. Like, for real … I’m always surprised by how surprised other people get when they see an actual Asian person speaking Spanish or Portuguese.

My adoptive parents are white and I have two brothers who are of Mexican descent.  My moms stepdad is also Mexican and her entire side of the family speaks Spanish.  So, growing up everyone assumed I was Mexican (I know that’s a nationality and not a race).  So I was always thought to be a Brown Mexican kid like my brothers and I honestly rarely ever fought anyone on it. People can think what they want.  You know what you are.  

Genetics is crazy.  My bio father was a pale guy with gray eyes and brown hair.  My bio mother was a light skinned brown Indian woman with very dark brown hair and green eyes.  I’m much darker than my mother.  I have a few pictures of her and in one she’s with her parents.  Her mother is also a light skinned Indian woman but her father is very dark skinned with radiant green eyes.  He’s Indian-Pakistani.  I happen to look the most like him than either of my biological parents.  

My friend from college is the same mix as me.  Ashkenazi and Indian.  White skin, pale gray eyes and curly light brown hair. 

Then I have two married friends who are both mixed race biracial (Black & white) and they have four kids that are each distinctively different shades.  I find it crazy cool, honestly. 

But I understand your frustrations.  We live in a world where how people perceive us has so much impact.  It doesn’t feel good to be told by others about our own identity.  At 16 this can be especially hard.

My advice is to surround yourself with supportive people.  Sometimes that’s hard when you are young though.  Do your parents have weird hang ups regarding their own racial identities?",pos

I grew up in a place where being mixed is actually quite common, but people still had trouble wrapping their minds around my particular mix. It’s frustrating, but eventually you get to a point where you reckon with how much you value other people’s perceptions of you, and how much you value being confident in yourself.

I think it’s wonderful that you’re seeking help in making sense of your mother’s actions and your own experience. I hope that it aids you in finding a sense of confidence and pride in your identity, and perhaps a bit of grace for your mother and her own experience. It is tragic, but certainly not an uncommon experience for folks to eschew their own culture in hopes of being accepted as “enough” to fit into their new context, and especially for immigrant parents to pass that down to their children with the hope that they’ll have an easier time than they did fitting in. If your family situation is like mine, perhaps your grandparents immigrated and passed that message to your mom, and perhaps it falls to us as the next generation to break that negative mindset and (re)connect with that culture, even despite resistance to your efforts.

In any case, I wish you strength on your journey.",pos

I ask because depending on how *connected* or *immersed* you are with Indian culture or people, when you declare your ethnic background it might come off as strange. When I see questions like this — I'm always curious on the lifestyle and disposition of the individual.

Looking at me myself. I've had friends that knew me for a a year or more and didn't know I was mixed or Portuguese. Some found out because they happened to hear me singing a song in Portuguese. Some learned because of how familiar I was with Japanese cuisine while on a work trip to Japan and that prompted to ask ""how I knew so much"". Though some people *clock* me as being mixed, many don't, but I also don't talk about being mixed much. Not sure what your lifestyle looks like but people ask me about my ethnicity usually over time because they *caught* something I did, or do, or saw a side of me they didn't know whats there and they asked. When they understand it's *culture* and *exposure* they ""get it"" even though I don't look mixed to everyone. From a global region perspective — most of my friends or their parents are from Spain, Portugal, the Mediterranean or a Spanish-speaking country (about 50% of the people I spend time with weekly) — this is often how many of my Black, White, Asian, and Indian friends have discovered this *other side*.
